# 📌 Data-Driven Zonation for Seismic Exposure Modeling via Machine Learning

## 📝 Abstract  
Loss estimation for seismic risk studies requires an **exposure model** that captures the spatial distribution of buildings, accounting for their seismic vulnerability and population.  
A key step in developing such models is the delineation of **Homogeneous Zones (HZs):** urban areas where buildings share similar construction practices that inform about their seismic performance.  

Traditionally, these zones are defined through expert judgment and visual interpretation, a process that is **time-consuming, hard to scale, and difficult to reproduce.**  

This work introduces a **data-driven methodology** that integrates **census, cadastral, and geospatial information** through **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to automate the creation of HZs.  

The approach combines:  
- 📊 Socioeconomic strata  
- 🏠 Building attributes  
- 📍 Spatial proximity  

By applying **dimensionality reduction** and **density-based clustering**, the method identifies coherent building groups.  

✅ When applied to a large urban center in Colombia, the methodology showed strong agreement with expert-defined exposure zoning while **reducing the need for field-based inspection by more than 65%**.
